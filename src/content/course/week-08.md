# Week 8: The Entry – The "Toll Booth" (Spreads)

Selling naked puts (Week 6) requires a lot of cash. If you don't have $14,000 to buy Apple, you can use the **Vertical Credit Spread**.

We call this "The Toll Booth." You set up a barrier, and the market pays you to pass by.



### 1. The Mechanics of a Put Credit Spread
Instead of just selling one option, you make two trades instantly:
1.  **Sell** the expensive Put (e.g., Strike $140). *You collect money.*
2.  **Buy** a cheaper Put (e.g., Strike $135) as protection. *You pay a little money.*

**Net Result:** You collect a "Credit" (Profit).
**Your Risk:** It is strictly limited to the width of the strikes ($5 wide). You can never lose more than that, even if the stock goes to zero.

### 2. Order Types
Never use a "Market Order." Market orders are for panic.
* **Limit Order:** "I will sell this spread for **$0.50** or better."
* You set the price. If the market doesn't give it to you, you don't trade.
* Walk your order down slowly. Don't chase price.

### 3. Entry Protocol
1.  Right click the chart -> "Sell Vertical".
2.  Check the "Mid Price."
3.  Set your Limit Order slightly above the Mid Price.
4.  Wait for the fill.
