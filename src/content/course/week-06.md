# Week 6: The Products – Selling Puts & Calls

Now you understand the math (Greeks) and the philosophy (Casino). It is time to learn the two specific transactions we use to make money.

### 1. The Cash Secured Put (Bullish Trade)
This is our primary weapon. You sell this when the market is **Bullish** (Green Ribbon, Inside Bar Breakout).

* **The Setup:** You have cash in your account. You want to buy a stock, but only if it's cheap.
* **The Trade:** "I promise to buy 100 shares of Apple at $140. Pay me $200 for this promise."
* **Scenario A (Stock goes up):** You keep the $200. You never have to buy the stock. (Free Money).
* **Scenario B (Stock crashes):** You are forced to buy Apple at $140. But since you kept the $200 premium, your actual cost is only $138. You got the stock at a discount!



### 2. The Covered Call (Bearish/Income Trade)
You sell this when you *already own* 100 shares of the stock, but the market looks weak or flat.

* **The Setup:** You own 100 shares of Apple. You want to collect rent on them.
* **The Trade:** "I promise to sell my 100 shares of Apple if it hits $160. Pay me $150 for this promise."
* **Scenario A (Stock stays flat/drops):** You keep your shares. You keep the $150 rent. You repeat this next week.
* **Scenario B (Stock moons to $170):** You are forced to sell your shares at $160. You keep the $150 premium + the profit from the stock appreciation up to $160. You missed the top, but you still made max profit.

### 3. The Wheel Strategy
This is the Sniper Ecosystem:
1.  **Sell Puts** to collect income until you are assigned stock.
2.  **Sell Calls** on that stock to collect rent until it gets called away.
3.  **Repeat.**
