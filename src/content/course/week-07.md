# Week 7: The Sniper Setup – The Kill Zone

You do not fire at everything that moves. You wait for the target to walk into the crosshairs.

A "Sniper Setup" only exists when **Phase 1 (The Chart)** and **Phase 2 (The Math)** agree perfectly. We call this overlap **The Kill Zone**.



### 1. The Confluence Checklist
Before you open your brokerage app, you must check these four boxes. If even one is missing, **NO TRADE.**

1.  **Trend:** Is the Monthly/Weekly Chart in your favor? (Green = Bullish).
2.  **Signal:** Do you have a Strat Signal? (Inside Bar Break or 2-1-2 Reversal).
3.  **Math:** Is the option Liquid? (Is the spread between Bid/Ask tight?).
4.  **Edge:** Can you get **30 Delta** or lower?

### 2. The "30-Minute" Rule
Amateurs rush in at 9:30 AM when the bell rings. Snipers wait.
* The first 30 minutes of the market are fake. It is just algorithms fighting over the opening price.
* **The Rule:** We do not enter new positions until **10:00 AM EST**. Let the dust settle. Let the candle close.

### 3. Sizing the Target
* **Implied Volatility (IV):** We prefer High IV.
* High IV means option premiums are expensive (inflated).
* Since we are SELLERS, we want to sell expensive things.
* **IV Rank > 30** is ideal.
