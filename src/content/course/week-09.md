# Week 9: The Defense – Rolling & BTC

You are in a trade. The market turns against you. The enemy is at the gates. Do you panic? No. You deploy countermeasures.

### 1. The "50% Rule" (Winning)
First, let's talk about winning.
* Greed kills Snipers.
* If you sell an option for **$1.00**, and two days later it is trading for **$0.50**, you have made 50% of your max profit.
* **The Rule:** BUY TO CLOSE (BTC) at 50% profit.
* Take the money off the table. Free up your buying power. Find the next trade. Don't wait for the last penny.

### 2. The "Roll" (Losing)
If the price challenges your strike (the stock drops to your Put level), we "Roll" the position.

**The Maneuver:**
1.  **Buy to Close** your current losing position.
2.  **Sell to Open** a *new* position for next week (giving yourself more time).
3.  **Net Result:** You usually collect *more* credit for doing this.

You are essentially saying: "Okay, you beat me this week. I bet you can't beat me next week." You are buying time using the market's own money.

### 3. The Stop Loss
If the thesis is broken (the Monthly chart turns Red), we do not roll. We accept defeat.
* **Max Loss Rule:** If the trade reaches **2x** the credit received, we close it.
* We live to fight another day.
