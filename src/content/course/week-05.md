# Week 5: The Greeks – Your Dashboard

If you are flying a plane, you need a dashboard to tell you your speed and altitude. In options trading, "The Greeks" are your dashboard. There are many Greeks, but as a Sniper, you only care about two: **Delta** and **Theta**.

### 1. Delta ($\Delta$): The Probability Gauge
Wall Street uses Delta to measure how much an option's price moves. But we use it as a **Probability Calculator**.

* **Delta ranges from 0 to 1.0.**
* **The Rule of Thumb:** Delta roughly equals the probability that the option will end up "In The Money" (ITM).
* **Our Target:** We look for **30 Delta** (0.30) or lower.
    * This means there is only a ~30% chance we lose.
    * It means there is a **~70% chance we win.**

If you sell a "10 Delta" option, you have a 90% theoretical win rate.

### 2. Theta ($\Theta$): The Rent Collector
Theta measures how much money the option loses *per day* purely due to time passing.

* **Theta = Cash per day.**
* If you sell an option with a Theta of **0.05**, you make **$5 per day** per contract, even if the stock price doesn't move an inch.
* **The Curve:** Theta decay is not linear. It accelerates. The closer you get to expiration (0 days left), the faster the money melts into your pocket.



### 3. The Sniper Sweet Spot
We combine these two to find our trade:
1.  Find a stock with a Bullish Chart (Week 1-3).
2.  Go to the Option Chain.
3.  Look for the **30 Delta** strike price.
4.  Check the **Theta** (ensure you are getting paid enough to wait).
