# Week 12: The Finale – Certified Sniper

Congratulations. You have completed the curriculum. You now possess the tools that 90% of retail traders are ignorant of.

You understand:
1.  **The Engine:** How to read price action (Inside Bars/Strat).
2.  **The Business:** Why we sell options instead of buying them (Theta).
3.  **The Execution:** How to enter, manage, and defend trades (Spreads/Rolling).
4.  **The Mindset:** How to manage risk and emotion.

### The Sniper Contract
Before you place your next live trade, you must agree to the following:

> **I hereby certify that:**
> 1. I will never enter a trade without checking the Monthly/Weekly trend.
> 2. I will never risk more than 5% of my account on one trade.
> 3. I will never chase a trade past the entry point.
> 4. I will take profit at 50% and not get greedy.
> 5. I will treat this as a business, not a casino.

### What Now?
Your training is done, but your journey is just starting.
* **Step 1:** Paper trade these concepts for 4 weeks. Prove you can follow the rules without risking real money.
* **Step 2:** Fund your account with an amount you can afford to lose.
* **Step 3:** Take one good shot at a time.

**Welcome to the 10%. Welcome to the Sniper Team.**
