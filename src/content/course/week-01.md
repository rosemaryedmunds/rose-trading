# Week 1: The Engine – Compressing Price

Trading is not about guessing where the price will go. It is about identifying where the energy is building up.

Imagine you are holding a spring. If you just hold it loosely, it has no power. But if you place it on a table and push down on it with all your weight, that spring is now dangerous. It isn't moving, but it is full of **Potential Energy**.

The stock market works exactly the same way.

### 1. The Inside Bar (The Spring)
The most powerful signal in trading is the **Inside Bar**.
* **Definition:** A candle that is completely contained within the previous candle's High and Low.
* **The Psychology:** The market is "taking a breath." Buyers and Sellers are in equilibrium. No one is winning. The price is compressing.
* **The Result:** When price finally breaks out of this range, it usually moves violently.

### 2. The Strat Numbers
To communicate quickly, we assign numbers to candle types:
* **1 (Inside Bar):** The pause. The compression. (Yellow candle)
* **2 (Directional Bar):** The breakout. Price breaks the High or Low of the previous candle.
* **3 (Outside Bar):** The chaos. Price breaks BOTH the High and Low. Avoid these.

### 3. The Setup: The "2-1-2"
This is your bread and butter trade.
1.  **Event 1 (The 2):** A directional move happens (e.g., a big Green candle).
2.  **Event 2 (The 1):** The market pauses (Inside Bar). Price stays within the Green candle's range.
3.  **Event 3 (The Break):** Price breaks above the Inside Bar's high.
4.  **The Trigger:** You enter the trade exactly when price crosses that high.

> **Key Rule:** We do not predict the breakout. We wait for the price to cross the line. If it doesn't cross, we don't trade.
