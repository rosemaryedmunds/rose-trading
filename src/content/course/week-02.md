# Week 2: The Direction – Do Not Fight the River

In Week 1, we learned about the "Engine" (Inside Bars). Now we need to know which way the car is driving.

### 1. Time Frame Continuity (TFC)
The most common mistake new traders make is Shorting a stock because "it looks too high," while the Monthly, Weekly, and Daily charts are all green. That is like trying to stop a freight train with your bare hands.

**The Rule:** We only trade in the direction of the **Aggregate Time Frame**.
* If the Month is Green, we look for Buys.
* If the Month is Red, we look for Sells.

### 2. The Ribbon (Saty's Ribbon)
We use a specific Moving Average ribbon to visualize the "River."
* **Green Ribbon:** The trend is UP. (Only look for 2-1-2 Bullish setups).
* **Red Ribbon:** The trend is DOWN. (Only look for Bearish setups).
* **Grey/Twisting:** The market is confused. STAY OUT.

> **Sniper Tip:** A "Twisting" ribbon is the "Kill Zone" for your account. It means chop. We do not trade chop.
