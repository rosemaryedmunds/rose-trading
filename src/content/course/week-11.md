# Week 11: The Mindset – Psychology

The market is a mirror. It reflects your own flaws back at you. If you are greedy, it will rob you. If you are fearful, it will freeze you.



### 1. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)
You see a stock rocketing up. You feel stupid for not being in it. You buy at the top.
* **The Sniper Reality:** There is always another bus coming.
* If you missed the entry (The Kill Zone), let it go. Chasing a trade is the fastest way to lose money.
* **Mantra:** "I trade my setup, or I trade nothing."

### 2. Revenge Trading
You took a loss. You feel angry. You want your money back *now*. You double your size on the next trade to "make it back."
* **The Result:** You usually lose that one too. Now you are down 2x.
* **The Fix:** If you take a full loss, **walk away from the screen.** Close the laptop. Go outside. Do not trade again until tomorrow.

### 3. Boredom
The Sniper Business is boring. Selling Theta is like watching paint dry.
* Amateurs crave excitement/action.
* Professionals crave boredom/consistency.
* If you want excitement, go to Las Vegas. If you want income, stay here.
